# Pump-it-up---Data-driven-challenge-for-data-mining-the-water-table

A predictive classification model was developed as part of data driven competition - Pump it up, where the challenge is to predict the 
working condition of water points by identifying which pumps are functional, which needs repair and which doesnâ€™t work using the data from 
Tanzanian Ministry of Water.
